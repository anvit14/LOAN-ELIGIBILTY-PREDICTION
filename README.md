# LOAN-ELIGIBILTY-PREDICTION
With the improvements within the banking sector numerous individuals are
applying for bank loans yet the bank has its limited resources which it has
to grant to a small amount of people only, so finding out to whom the loan
can be permitted which will be a safer option for the bank is a typical
process. So in this project we try to reduce this risk element behind
selecting the safe person so as to save lots of bank endeavor and assets.
This is done by using data of the preceding records of the people to whom
the loan was granted before and on the basis of these records the machine
was trained using the python and ML model which give the most precise
result. The main objective of this project is to predict whether assigning the
loan to a specific person will be safe or not.
